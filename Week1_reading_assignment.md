###### In Matt Przybala’s article “Should a Data Scientist Know How to Code?,” Pryzbala tackles the fundamental difference between two conflated job niches: a data scientist and a data business analyst. Throughout the piece, Pryzbala explains that many large corporations will title a role “data scientist” when in reality they are seeking a business-oriented individual to analyze statistics with very little coding required. Data analysts primarily use tools such as visualizations, SQLs, and statistics to make valuable insights that primarily drive business. However, true data scientists typically use more coding skills, such as object-oriented programming, to create fully automated machine learning pipelines. Although some companies separate the two positions, Przybyla emphasizes that the best data scientists should be able to complete both functions, bringing tremendous value to their organization.
