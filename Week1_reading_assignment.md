# Week 1 Assignment

###### In Matt Przybala’s article “Should a Data Scientist Know How to Code?,” Pryzbala tackles the fundamental difference between two conflated job niches: a data scientist and a data business analyst. Throughout the piece, Pryzbala explains that many large corporations will title a role “data scientist” when in reality they are seeking a business-oriented individual to analyze statistics with very little coding required. Data analysts primarily use tools such as visualizations, SQLs, and statistics to make valuable insights that primarily drive business. However, true data scientists typically use more coding skills, such as object-oriented programming, to create fully automated machine learning pipelines. Although some companies separate the two positions, Przybyla emphasizes that the best data scientists should be able to complete both functions, bringing tremendous value to their organization. 
	As someone with both research and business aspirations, I enjoyed reading about the difference between the two roles, as well as how to maximize my potential at any future organization that I join. Although Pryzbala separated the two into distinct “categories,” I prefer to look at them as applicable to different phases in my career. At this stage in my professional development, I am primarily conducting research at large institutions who already have excellent business teams. Consequently, I can create the most value by developing fully automated pipelines that support the work of my superiors. However, as I move to a more independent position and become responsible for my own business practices, I will be required to utilize more data analysis skills while my supporting researchers concentrate on machine learning. Nevertheless, in both phases I will be using both strategies, just in different proportions. As a result, while I agree with Przybyla that these two fields are different, I see them intrinsically linked together as I progress throughout my career.
